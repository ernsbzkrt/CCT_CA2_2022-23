Irish potato prices are the second-highest in Europe
"State is also the most expensive country in EU for alcohol, according to Eurostat study"
"Ireland is the second most expensive country in Europe in which to buy potatoes and the third-dearest country for eggs, milk and cheese, according to a study published by the EU's statistics agency."
"High prices for what have long been considered staples of the Irish diet have been blamed on retailers who, farmers say, insist on higher margins than elsewhere in the EU and reject as much as 30 per cent of potato crops because of perceived blemishes."
An increase in the amount of imported potatoes from the UK is also a factor in driving prices higher.
"The Eurostat price comparison study reveals the Republic was the fourth most expensive country in the EU for food and non-alcoholic drinks last year, with prices running at 119 per cent of the EU average."
"Only Denmark, Sweden and Austria were more expensive."
"Across all categories, the Republic was more expensive than the average."
"The figures show Ireland was the dearest country for alcohol, with prices running at 175 per cent of the EU average and the second most expensive for tobacco, with such products costing 189 per cent.

Only the UK is more expensive for smokers.
"Fruit, vegetable and potatoes in the Republic are 135 per cent of the EU average with only Sweden more expensive."
"When it comes to milk, cheese and eggs, Cyprus is the dearest country with prices at 140 per cent of the EU average while in Greece prices are 131 per cent of the average. In the Republic the price is 128 per cent of the average."
"""The prices Irish farmers receive for their produce are broadly in line with EU averages,"" said IFA president Joe Healy, adding that average farm income, at â‚¬26,500, reflected ""the low prices farmers receive""."
"Eddie Doyle, chairman of the IFA's potato division, placed the blame for higher prices here on retailers who he said had ""the whole thing sewn up""."
